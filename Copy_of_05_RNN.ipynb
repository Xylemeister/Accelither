        "\n",
        "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a specific type of architecture that is widely used to deal with sequential information. So far, the introduced CNN architectures from the previous tutorials treated inputs as independent objects, however, many applications need to deal with data that is interconnected. For instance, if you are translating a sentence from English to Taiwanese, and you are predicting the next word, it is useful to know which words came before the last one.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs are called recurrent since they apply the same operation to each of the input sequences, with the output of an individual element being dependent on the previous one. Theoretically, RNNs establish a connection between the actual input and ALL the previous ones. Although this is assumed, in the practice, RNNs have proven to only *remember* a limited number of inputs. In other words, RNNs have a *memory* that allows them to *remember* previous elements and use their information to deal with the current input.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs can be split into multiple types depending on their applications. For instance, if we want to predict one word given only the previous one, the topology of our network is a *One to One*. Another example is image captioning, where we can design a *One to Many* architecture to obtain a description from a single input image. The following diagram shows the different types of problems we can face ([Source](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)):\n",

        "Now that we have the sequence in the form of a list of integers,  we could input that directly to the RNN. However, as those numbers are arbitraryly chosen, it would be really hard for the RNN to understand the relationships between the words. To give the model more representation power, we first want to transform the integer to a vector of dimension $d$ which represents the semantic meaning of the words. Each of these vectors is called an Embedding. The actual values of the vectors are not important, only the relationships between them. For example, `dog` and `cat` vectors are probably going to be closer than `dog` and `the`. Or if you are doing sentiment classification, probably two words encoding similar positive sentiments will be closer than a word expressing positive sentiments and a completely neutral word.\n",

In this case we are loading the $20000$ most common words in IMDB, so each word would be encoded in a vector of dimensionality $20000$. Secondly, the encoding does not give any notion of similarity between the different words. For these two reasons, embedding the words to a common lower dimensionality space is also better than using one-hot encoding."

In this dataset the number of words is really large, so if we used a word-level model the number of available classes would be quite large if we did not filter the number of possible words. For this example, instead of encoding on a word level, we will do it on a character level, which results in a more limited vocabulary. We aim to predict the next character when inputting a sentence of length $d$. In evaluation mode, i.e. when we are predicting the next character, we then input a seed of $d$ characters as the first input, and afterwards we use the last $d$ characters as input to predict the next character.\n",

However, word-level models usually present higher performance as it easier for them to keep track of the long-term meaning of the sentence, and also can avoid any spelling mistakes that may happen in character-level models.\n",

        "We now take any of the sequences from the test split and use it as an initial pattern for our model. Then we enter a loop where given an input sequence, we predict the next character and then form a new input sequence by appending the predicted character and dropping the first character.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever we input a sequence, we obtain as output a probability distribution of the possible characters. For example, given the sequence `the cat and the do` the model will output a probability distribution of the next character where probably the character `g` will have a high probability (forming then `the cat and the dog`). However, the character `c` can also be a possibility, as the sentence formed may be `the cat and the doctor`. When deciding what character to predict, a strategy is to just take the character with the maximum probability at all times, but then the variability of the formed text is then smaller. Another option would be to sample following the same probability of distribution as the model outputs. However, this might result in a excessive variability with some sentences not making any sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "This trade-off of variability against more probable sequences is controlled by what it is called the temperature of the sampling process. The temperature controls the smoothing of the probability vector. A temperature close to 0 will result in taking always the safest (i.e. that with the highest probability) as the next element. A temperature close to 1 will decide on the next element following the same distribution of probability as the original output of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a more formal way, being $p_i$ the probability of the element $i$ output by the RNN model and $T$ the temperature, the probability after applying the mentioned smoothing $\\hat{p_i}$ is:\n",

        "\n",
        "For a quantitative evaluation of the generated text we will use a metric commonly used in image captioning and translation tasks, BLEU. BLEU looks for matches on a word level between the generated text and the reference text. Specifically, BLEU looks for matches in n-grams up to $n=4$, where an n-gram is defined as a contiguous sentence of $n$ items. For example, in the sentence `the sky is blue`, an n-gram of $n=2$ would be `is blue`. BLEU scores range from [0,1].\n",

        "As we mentioned, BLEU is usual in more constrained text generation tasks, such as image captioning. In our text generation task there is a large number of both grammatically and semantically correct possibilities when generating new sentences, and one of the issues for this task is to develop a metric that can properly evaluate the semantic and syntactic quality of the generated text. Human evaluation is quite common when evaluating the quality of generated sentences in these less constrained tasks due to the difficulty of finding proper automatic metrics. However, we hope to see a correlation between the BLEU score and the quality of the generated text. Here we take an input sentence from the test data and generate a sentence. Then, we compare the generated sentence to the real one from the corpus. We do so 20 times and provide the average BLEU score.\n",

A Transformer does not use any recurrence, it instead uses attention to focus on specific parts of a sentence.

This exercise expects you to study the impact of the `window_size` variable when defining the `train` and `test` dataset splits. Remember that the `window_size` variable indicates the number of past observations used for predicting the current value. Here, we treat the `test` split as a validation set."

Labels in IMDB are 0 for negative reviews and 1 for positive reviews. The definitions of the models you will use for this task are given the code below. This task is similar to the transfer learning/finetuning task in the CNN Architectures notebook, however we now test the effect of transfer learning in the embeddings. In this task we use train, validation and test splits with Early Stopping. That means that we will take the best performing model in the validation set and use it in the test set to get a final performance.\n",

Then train another model with an LSTM and trainable embeddings initialized at random (called `lstm_model`). Finally train a model with an LSTM with non-trainable embeddings initialized with GloVe embeddings (called `lstm_glove_model`). The code to train the three models is given below. Report in a table the test accuracy obtained after training with the given code for the three models. Also attach in the Appendix the training and validation accuracy curves for the different models trained. You can report the curves after using EarlyStopping with patience 10 (already given in the code), so you don't have to train for the full 50 epochs the three models. Discuss the results.\n",
